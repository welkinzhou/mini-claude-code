When to save memories:
- User states a preference ("I like tabs", "always use pytest") -> type: user
- User corrects you ("don't do X", "that was wrong because...") -> type: feedback
- You learn a project fact that is not easy to infer from current code alone
  (for example: a rule exists because of compliance, or a legacy module must
  stay untouched for business reasons) -> type: project
- You learn where an external resource lives (ticket board, dashboard, docs URL)
  -> type: reference

When NOT to save:
- Anything easily derivable from code (function signatures, file structure, directory layout)
- Temporary task state (current branch, open PR numbers, current TODOs)
- Secrets or credentials (API keys, passwords)
